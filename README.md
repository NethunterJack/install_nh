Pre-Requesites:

Busybox
Root (Kingroot may be incompatible)
GOOOOD STORAGE
Terminal Emulator app

Install Instructions:

* Download the zip file in the description
* Extract it to the root of your sdcard or internal memory
* Open the terminal emulator app
* Type "su" and give root permissions
* Type "sh /sdcard/install_nh-master/nh.sh"
* Wait until the Nethunter App opens and then give root permissions
* Wait until the Nethunter app close (it closes automatically and may take 1~2 minutes to close)
* Then you will probably see some errors in the terminal once the Nethunter App closes, but it's normal just wait until you can type the next command
* Finally once you can finally type a command type "exit" or close the terminal app and go to the Nethunter app to install Chroot (Full Chroot recommended)
* After install Chroot Full type "apt-get update" and after that "apt-get upgrade".
* In case you install Chroot minimal type "apt-get install kali-linux-nethunter" then type "apt-get update" and finally "apt-get upgrade" . Or you could install manually each desired package after instal minimal Chroot if you don't want all the NetHunter packages.
* Now you're done :)
